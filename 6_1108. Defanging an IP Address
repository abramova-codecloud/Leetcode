/**
Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.
A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

 
Example 1:
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"

Example 2:
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"


MY SOLUTION:
Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Defanging an IP Address.
Memory Usage: 37.4 MB, less than 60.44% of Java online submissions for Defanging an IP Address.
