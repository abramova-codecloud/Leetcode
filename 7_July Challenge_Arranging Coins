/**
July LeetCoding Challenge
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

Example 2:

n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
